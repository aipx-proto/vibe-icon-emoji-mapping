# Vibe Icon Emoji Mapping

This project maps [Fluent UI](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-system-icons) icons to their emoji counterparts. The goal is to enable translation from an emoji (e.g., generated by an LLM) to a corresponding Fluent icon for use in UI.

The result is use ind [vibe-icon](https://github.com/aipx-proto/vibe-icon) web component

## Project Overview

The process consists of several steps:

1. **Clone Fluent Icon SVGs**
   - Download the Fluent UI icon SVGs from the official repository.
2. **Convert SVGs to PNGs**
   - Transform the SVG files into PNG images for easier processing.
3. **Map PNGs to Emojis**
   - Read the PNGs and emoji metadata, then use a language model to determine which emoji best matches each PNG image.
4. **Disambiguation**
   - If multiple PNGs or emojis map to the same thing, a disambiguation step selects the one with the highest similarity score.
5. **Manual Tie-Breaking**
   - A tie-break JSON file allows for manual overrides of ambiguous mappings.

`final-mapping.json` is the final resulting map The resulting mapping of icons to emojis.

## Report

### Approach
The icon-to-emoji mapping was generated using a few-shot prompting strategy with a language model. 
Example icon inputs and their corresponding emoji outputs were provided to guide the model. 
Icons were grouped by name or category, allowing the model to evaluate sets of related icons together, 
which improved efficiency and contextual accuracy compared to evaluating each icon individually.

### Limitations
- **Consistency:** The mapping process sometimes produced inconsistent results across large icon sets that were split up too much.
- **One-to-One Mapping:** Each emoji was mapped to only one icon, but ideally, multiple emojis (e.g., all heart variants) should map to a single icon.
- **Compound Icons:** Icons representing compound concepts (e.g., a document with a plus sign) were intended to map to emoji pairs, but this was not reliably achieved.

### Future Improvements
- **Many-to-One Mapping:** Support mapping multiple emojis to a single icon. For example, map all heart color variants to a single "heart" icon: `"heart": ["‚ù§Ô∏è", "üß°", "üíõ", "üíö", "üíô" ... ]`
- **Compound Emoji Sets:** Enable mapping of compound icons to sets of emojis to better represent complex iconography. 
- **Emoji-First Approach:** Instead of starting with icons and asking which emoji fits, iterate through the emoji sets and assign possible icons, then use the language model to evaluate and refine these mappings for greater consistency.
